            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At GradePad, we believe that every student deserves the tools to succeed academically. Our mission is to empower students with intelligent grade tracking and analytics that help them understand their performance, identify areas for improvement, and ultimately achieve their academic goals.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>GradePad was built because students were struggling. Keeping track of grades was boring, and all existing sites were outdated. Almost all sites didn't let you store grades properly.</p>
            <p>We saw the problem firsthand. Students were spending hours on spreadsheets, losing track of assignments, and struggling to understand how their current grades affected their final mark. Traditional grade trackers were clunky, dated, and rarely built with the modern student in mind.</p>
            <p>That's when we decided to create GradePad, a grade tracking tool that's actually designed for how students work today. We built something simple, intuitive, and genuinely useful. No more outdated interfaces, no more confusing spreadsheets, and definitely no more frustration with clunky tools that don't let you properly store and track your grades.</p>
            <p>GradePad is more than just a tracker. It's a tool built by students who understand the struggle, for students who want to succeed without the hassle.</p>

            <h2>Built by a Student, for Students</h2>
            <p>GradePad was developed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisjackson-" target="_blank" style="color: #ffffff; text-decoration: underline;">Chris Jackson</a>, a student who understands the challenges of academic life firsthand. He juggles multiple classes, assignments, and exams while trying to maintain good grades and a balanced life.</p>
            <p>Built from our own frustrations with existing grade tracking solutions, GradePad was created to be the tool we wished existed when we were struggling to track our grades. This isn't just software built by a student; it's a platform created by someone who lives the same struggles you do and designed it to actually help you succeed.</p>
