            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At GradePad, we believe that every student deserves the tools to succeed academically. Our mission is to empower students with intelligent grade tracking and analytics that help them understand their performance, identify areas for improvement, and ultimately achieve their academic goals.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>GradePad was born from a simple observation: students were struggling to keep track of their academic performance across multiple subjects and assignments. Traditional methods like spreadsheets were clunky, and existing solutions were either too complex or lacked the insights students truly needed.</p>
            <p>We set out to create something different - a grade tracker that doesn't just store numbers, but provides meaningful insights and helps students make data-driven decisions about their academic journey. Built by students, for students.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Built by Students, for Students</h2>
            <p>GradePad is developed by a team of current and former students who understand the challenges of academic life. We've been in your shoes - juggling multiple classes, assignments, and exams while trying to maintain good grades and a balanced life.</p>
            <p>Our diverse team brings together expertise in education, technology, and user experience to create a tool that truly serves the student community. We're not just building software; we're building a platform that empowers academic success.</p>
